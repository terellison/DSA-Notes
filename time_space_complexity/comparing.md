# How to compare algorithms

## Experimental Analysis

Measures the <u>actual</u> time an algorithm took to execute. Since this requires writing, compiling, and running different algorithms, this method is inefficient.

## Theoretical Analysis

In theoretical analysis, an algorithms execution time and space required to execute are defined as a function of the algorithms input.

### Time Complexity Examples



| Name      | Complexity | Description          |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| Quadratic | O(N^2)     | Time grows as a function of the square of input (e.g. N = 10, Time = 100s)|
| Linear    | O(N)       | Time is correspondant to the amount of input (e.g. N = 10, Time = 10s)|
| Constant  | O(1)       | Time is constant irrespective of the amount of input (e.g. N = 10, Time = 1s; N = 1000, T ~1s)|
